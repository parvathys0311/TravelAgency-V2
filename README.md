### Issues encountered on the way & how it is being tackled

 - Encountered issues when placing a text on top of an image. It is a sizing issue and is unable to get a perfect layout.
   - Orginal design plan was to have a title placed centered to picture, with a link attached to it. However, for now, the title/text is removed temperorily. Instead the image itself is a direct link to another site.  

- Unable to get font awesome menu icon image to display, when view is in potrait mode. Menu navigation works well in both screen views, but the image for icon is not being displayed.
