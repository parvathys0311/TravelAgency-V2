      - flex items - Site heading, a tag line & signup button
      - The flex items are aligned to be centered in the herosection

   - Form is done through a static form service and all submissions will be diverted to my email

 - Footer - Is the same for all pages. It is made to remain at bottom irrespective of content size.

- Register Page for Signup:

  - Main body contains a register form centered in the page
    - All inputs are accessible with labels, legends & fieldset

- Login Page 
  - Header & Footer remains same as other pages
  - Main body contains a login form 
    - All inputs are accessible with labels, legends & fieldset

### Issues encountered on the way & how it is being tackled
 - Herosection - The 3 flex items - h2, p and button - It is now placed centered. Initially intention was to place these flex items horizontally centered, but vertically at bottom, (ps:the hero-section image chosen was different from the one now). It worked fine in big screen, but in mobile view, as the writings are at the bottom, the p tag and button disappears. I was not able to fix it by tweaking css. Would this needs JS? Haven't tried JS for now, instead have changed the herosection picture and maintained the flex items centered horizontally & vertically

 - Had issues with tweaking the width of the fieldset. 
    - Changed it by using display: inline-block after some search in stack overflow 

 - Encountered issues with maintaining footer at bottom
   - Solved it by getting help from freecodecamp website
